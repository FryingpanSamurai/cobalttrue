# CobaltTrue
Monotone Blues with Green Splashed

![Screenshot of CobaltTrue on VSCode.](images/ct-ss.png)


## Based on Nautical Color Palette
Originally, I had gone with a purple, blue & teal palette.
After a while it was looking more like the infamous NightOwl and that wasn't my goal.

I wanted something that was more reliant on contrast than color.
I've been a big champion of Dark+, but frankly it was a bit too bright and the color scheme was something to be desired.

The objective of this theme was to deliver a subdued 'monotone' blue-centric dark theme.



## ON THE HORIZON:
- [ ] Further testing to solidify color themeing
- [..] Investigate color theme for file formats related to data structure/content (i.e. .json, .md, .bson, etc.)
- [..] Investigate color theme for other languages
- [..] Consider parenthesis recolor and priority contrast
- [ ] Night vs Day use, impacts/ease of use/readability/eye strain
- [ ] Testing impact of 'monotone' use of similar hues
- [ ] Color Themeing for GitHub source changes and file modifications
- [ ] Themeing for error handling and CSS structure
- [ ] A11y compliancy checks
- [ ] Debugging Themeing
- [ ] Highlight color masks some of the selected text


***This is still a work in progress. Theme optimized for python development only (as of 5/9/23).***
*Feel free to share your thoughts and opinions about the theme. This is my first hand at developing a color theme.*
